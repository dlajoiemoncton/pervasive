Description: This package provides three functions for pervasiveness analyses relevant to correlational data. The OPCP function provides the observed proportion of concordant pairs. This is calculated from Kendall's Tau. A pair of rows (i.e., participants) is concordant when the row with the higher score on one variable also has higher scores on the other variable. Ties are ignored. The two pervasive functions essentially act as a wrapper to the arules package to find specific sets of association rules that are likely to be of interest to researchers.
